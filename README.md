# Zenora

## About

The basic idea of Zenora is that it's an online space where people can make and take courses. Users can create their own courses on different topics and sell them if they want. Others can sign up for these courses to learn new skills or gain knowledge. To make it more engaging, we're adding a point system. If you make a course or help someone by answering their questions, you get Karma points. If you complete a course, you get Zen points. These points can be used to get discounts on other courses. So, it's a two-way street: you learn something new and you also help others learn.
